# About
- It's an implementation of the Eisenhower Matrix in next.js using the habitica api. The Eisenhower Matrix is an algorthim for organizing.
	- If an activity is urgent and important, it should be done immediately. 
	- If an activity is important but not urgent, it should be scheduled when to start the activity
	- If an activity is not important but urgent, you should order someone else to do it
	- If an activity is neither important nor urgent, it should be avoided
